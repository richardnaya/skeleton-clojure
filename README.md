Welcome to the Clojure Web Skeleton project.  This project is for getting started with web development in Clojure.  It uses [Ring], [Compojure], and [Hiccup].  The rest is up to you.

## Prerequisites

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

This command should open a browser for you.  If it doesn't, the web server should be listening at, http://localhost:3000/

To run the tests for the project, run:

    lein test
